# wp-performance
WP Performance is a performance plugin that aims to make that "speed up" process a bit simpler by adding a variety of performance tweaks to your WordPress site.
This plugin generates static html files from your dynamic content, and it uses mod_rewrite to load cache files which is the fastest method.
